# Hi we're Alfred.

## Why we exist 
Our mission is to build things that help make the world radically better.  


## What we do
Teams with diverse backgrounds and skills choose a problem to tackle. We rapidly learn and iterate to come up with a radical solution that consider people and planet. We quickly put the solution out into the world. The profit helps us continue to create impact.

Our goal is to make the world radically better. We're not there yet and we don't have all the answers. We'll make mistakes along the way, but when we do we'll try our best to fix them. Our ambition is to maximize our positive impact and minimize our negative impact. 

We're interested in renewable energy, sustainable transportation, clean water & food generation, learning facilitation and space exploration.
