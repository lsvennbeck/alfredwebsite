    <h1>Our mission is to build things that make the world radically better.</h1>


    <div id="whatWeDo">
    <p>Teams with diverse backgrounds and skills choose a problem to tackle. We rapidly learn and iterate to come up with a radical solution that consider people and planet. We quickly put the solution out into the world. The profit helps us continue to create impact.
